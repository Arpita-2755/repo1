## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Flutter SDK](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install) (version 3.29.0+)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- Platform-specific development tools:

  | Platform | Requirements |
  |----------|--------------|
  | **Windows** | Visual Studio with C++ Build Tools |
  | **Linux** | g++, make, and required development libraries |
  | **macOS** | Xcode with Command Line Tools |

### Building the Native Libraries

The system monitoring features rely on native code implementations for accurate metrics. Before running the app, you need to build the native libraries:

1. Navigate to the `native` directory:
   ```bash
   cd native
   ```

2. Build the libraries according to your platform:

   **macOS/Linux**:
   ```bash
   chmod +x build.sh
   ./build.sh
   ./post_build.sh
   ```

   **Windows** (run from Visual Studio Developer Command Prompt):
   ```cmd
   build.bat
   post_build.bat
   ```

### Running the Application

After building the native libraries, you can run the application:

```bash
flutter run -d windows  # For Windows
flutter run -d macos    # For macOS
flutter run -d linux    # For Linux
```
